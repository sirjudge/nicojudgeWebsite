# repo for nicojudge.com 
## Overview
This is a Rust project using the leptos framework to build a website for nicojudge.com

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [leptos](https://leptos.dev/)

## Running your project

`cargo leptos watch`  
By default, you can access your local project at `http://localhost:3000`. 
If you want to run on a different port, you can edit the variable in cargo.toml 


## Executing a Server on a Remote Machine Without the Toolchain
After running a `cargo leptos build --release` the minimum files needed are:

1. The server binary located in `target/server/release`
2. The `site` directory and all files within located in `target/site`

Copy these files to your remote server. The directory structure should be:
```text
leptos_start
site/
```
Set the following environment variables (updating for your project as needed):
```sh
export LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME="leptos_start"
export LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT="site"
export LEPTOS_SITE_PKG_DIR="pkg"
export LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:3000"
export LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="3001"
```
Finally, run the server binary.
